# How's My Ipsum

#### _Epicodus JavaScript Frameworks Independent Project Number Four, 4 November 2016_

#### By _**HK Kahng**_

## Description

Project Requirements: Create an application where users may rate Lorem Ipsums, or other areas of interest (ie: festivals, climbing gear, yoga classes, recipes, books, video games, local hikes, etc).

* The Lorem Ipsum (or whatever users will review in your app) will have many ratings.
* Ratings may be any metric of your choosing, and could include a comment/explanation if you desire.
* Use a helper to display nicely formatted timestamps, and/or represent ratings visually (ie: display stars, or thumbs up/thumbs down).
* Include at least one computed property.
* Use a service to allow users to create a list of "favorite Lorem Ipsums" (or whatever thing users review in your specific app).
* There should be an option to add new Lorem Ipsums/things to review. This can either be an admin-style page, or something available to all users.
